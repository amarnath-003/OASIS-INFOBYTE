# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their measurements. The dataset used in this project contains features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Build a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers.
- **Dataset:** The Iris dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris 
- **Model:** Decision Tree Classifier was chosen for its initial simplicity and interpretability.
- **Evaluation Metric:** The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set.
