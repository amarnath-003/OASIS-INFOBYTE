# Unemployment Analysis Using Python

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on analyzing unemployment data in India using Python. The analysis involves exploring regional disparities, urban-rural dynamics, and correlations between different factors such as the estimated unemployment rate, employed individuals, and labor participation rate.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data:** Contains the dataset used for analysis (`Unemployment in India.csv`).

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

- **Plots:** Visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amarnath-003/OASIS-INFOBYTE.git
   cd OASIS-INFOBYTE
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the Notebooks directory
3. Run the cells in the notebooks to execute the code and generate visualizations.

## Key Findings
-**Regional Disparities:** Variations in unemployment rates across different regions were observed.

-**Urban-Rural Dynamics:** Significant differences in unemployment rates between urban and rural areas were highlighted.

-**Correlation Analysis:** Relationships between the estimated unemployment rate, employed individuals, and labor participation rate were explored.

## Conclusion
This project contributes to understanding the complexities of unemployment in India, providing insights that can inform evidence-based decision-making and contribute to the development of effective strategies.
