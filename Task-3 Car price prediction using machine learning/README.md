# Car Price Prediction Project

This project analyzes a dataset of car information and builds a machine learning model to predict the selling price of cars based on various features. The dataset includes details such as car age, present price, fuel type, transmission type, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the factors influencing the selling prices of cars and to develop a machine learning model for predicting these prices. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the training of a linear regression model.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
